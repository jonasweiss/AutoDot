    "# Quantum device tuning via hypersurface sampling\n",
    "**NOTE: DUE TO MULTIPROCESSING PACKAGE THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ONLY WORKS ON UNIX/LINUX OPERATING SYSTEMS [TO RUN ON WINDOWS FOLLOW THIS GUIDE](Resources/Running_on_windows.ipynb)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum devices used to implement spin qubits in semiconductors are challenging to tune and characterise. Often the best approaches to tuning such devices is manual tuning or a simple heuristic algorithm which is not flexible across devices. This repository contains the statistical tuning approach detailed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02589 with some additional functionality, a quick animated explanation of the approach detailed in the paper is available [here](Resources/Algorithm_overview/README.ipynb). This approach is promising as it make few assumptions about the device being tuned and hence can be applied to many systems without alteration. **For instructions on how to run a simple fake environment to see how the algorithm works see [this README.md](Playground/README.ipynb)**\n",

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "The required packages required to run the algorithm are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "scikit-image\n",
    "scipy\n",

    "# Using the algorithm\n",
    "Using the algorithm varies depending on what measurement software you use in your lab or what you want to achieve. Specifically if your lab utilises pygor then you should call a different function to initiate the tuning. If you are unable to access a lab then you can still create a virtual environment to test the algorithm in using the Playground module. Below is documentation detailing how to run the algorithm for each of these situations.\n",
    "## Without pygor\n",
    "To use the algorithm without pygor you must create the following:\n",
    "- jump\n",
    "- measure\n",
    "- check\n",
    "- config_file\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an **EXAMPLE** of how jump, check, and measure **COULD** be defined for a 5 gate device with 2 investigation (in this case plunger) gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>jump:</ins>\n",
    "Jump should be a function that takes an array of values and sets them to the device. It should also accept a flag that details whether the investigation gates (typically plunger gates) should be used. \n",

    "    \n",
    "  assert len(params) == len(labels) #params needs to be the same length as labels\n",
    "  for i in range(len(params)):\n",
    "    set_value_to_dac(labels[i],params[i]) #function that takes dac key and value and sets dac to that value\n",
    "  return params\n",

    "measure should be a function that returns the measured current on the device.\n",
